## A CI tool
gets the latest version of the code
or is triggered by a commit or a pull
build the final working files that will be deployed to production

aside: binary
output of a compilation process
C is compiled down to machine code, output code doesn't look anything like the input.

regression testing:
every time you find a bug, fix it and write tests to check for it coming back


CI can create a demo environment for you to do testing in. Before you merge your branch to master you can see what will happen in a safe environment

Version locking. If you have many micro services you can have them all be written in different environments with different node moduals and gems. We keep track of them with NVM and RVM.

post build actions.
