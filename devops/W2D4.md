we used opsworks so that if there is an unfixable bug we can just start a new instance


cislog - manages logs on linux
shows the kernel log
cislog just collects log messages and writes it to a file
we can have the write file be external ( a log server )
thus all machines will write all logs on a single device ( a log server )

using elastic search (open source search engine) we can go through all those logs
