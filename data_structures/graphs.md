# Intro to Graph Theory

## What are graphs?
Graphs are a way to formally represent a network, a collection of interconnected objects.

Formal definition: G = (V, E)

A graph is an ordered pair of two objects:
1. A set a vertices
2. A set of edges

An edge is uniquely identified by its two endpoints. Edges can be directed (one way), or undirected (two way).

For directed graphs (digraphs) vs undirected graphs. Both graphs have the same properties for vertices. Directed graphs have ordered pairs of edges, undirected graphs have unordered pairs of edges. Directed graphs have ordered pairs because travel is only permitted from the origin to the destination, reverse travel is not possible.

max edges in a graph = [ V * (V-1) ] / 2
